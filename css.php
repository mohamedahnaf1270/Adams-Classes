            <h1>CSS Cascading Style Sheet</h1>
            <hr>
        <p>CSS is mainly used for web development or page design. It refers to the cascading style sheets that can format the web page layouts using many features. You can make text bold in CSS, style it, manage table size, and edit other aspects of the web pages to make them attractive. By using CSS, the user can give a uniform look to the website and its several pages. It does not only define the table but also meets other design needs of the website.</p>
        <p>With the help of CSS, the user can make changes in several pages just at once. Suppose, if you need to make the text bigger of all the web pages, then by changing the font size in CSS, you can make the text size bigger. And there are many other things that you can do easily using cascading style sheets. And because of these features, CSS has become a crucial language for web design and development.</p>
        <p>CSS came into existence in 1994, so it can provide a standard way to design the pages on the world wide web. And Mr. Lee developed a cascading style sheet for the same purpose. Because by this time, there was an immense demand for such a solution as HTML 4.01 was unable to give an appealing web page on its own. However, by seeing it, many people offered different styling sheets, but none of them succeeded as CSS. In its initial stage, it was primarily used for making websites accessible and appealing.</p>
